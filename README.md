Hi! This is my window manager. It's not functional yet. Come back later!

Basically, I can't find a window manager that I can make behave the way I want, so I'm making my own. For an idea of how I want it to work, go play around with the Haiku operating system for a while. Not just the basics, learn all the fancy WM tricks. They're nice.

Also it's going to look like Macintosh System 7 because I'm unusually fond of that OS
